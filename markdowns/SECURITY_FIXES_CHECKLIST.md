# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## 📝 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Set secure JWT_SECRET environment variable (32+ characters)
- [ ] Configure secure database connection
- [ ] Set up proper SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure production email settings
- [ ] Run security tests: `npm run test:security`
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set

- [ ] Verify admin routes are protected

## 🚨 CRITICAL NOTES

1. **JWT_SECRET**: Must be set to a secure random string of at least 32 characters
2. **HTTPS**: Ensure all production traffic uses HTTPS
3. **Database**: Use SSL connections in production
4. **Environment**: Never commit environment variables to version control
5. **Testing**: Run security tests before every deployment
